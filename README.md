# prezdebates-2016
Comparative speech analysis of usage for "Hispanic/Latin@" and "African-American/black" word choice for candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald J. Trump using data drawn from the 2016 presidential debates.

## Installation

Before running analyze.py, you will need to install the nltk module:

    $ sudo pip install -U nltk
    $ sudo pip install -U numpy

Once this is complete, you can run the script using:

    $ python analyze.py

For some reason, you may need to download additional nltk modules using the built-in installer. To do so, the following two commands on terminal:

    $ python
    >>> import nltk
    >>> nltk.download()

A NLTK Downloader GUI will open. From here, select "All packages" and click the Download button.
